### _Jeremiah LaRocco <jeremiah_larocco@fastmail.com>_

This is a library for connecting to the Spotify Web API.

It handles OAuth authentication/authorization (including automatic refresh),
scope handling (right now only add-scope), JSON deserialization, and provides
functions for making get, post, and put requests.

It also includes some higher level functions (play, pause, etc.) to show how the library
can be used.
